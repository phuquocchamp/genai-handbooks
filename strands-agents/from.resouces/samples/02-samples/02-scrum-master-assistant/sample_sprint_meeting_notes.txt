In our sprint planning call for Sprint 3 of our chocolate e-commerce platform MVP, the backend team raised several key points and tasks to focus on:

    API Optimization: The team identified a need to refactor our API endpoints for improved performance, particularly in product search and catalog browsing. We'll be implementing more efficient database queries and considering caching strategies to reduce response times.

    Payment Gateway Integration: A critical task this sprint is to integrate a secure payment gateway. We're leaning towards using Stripe's API for its robust security features and ease of implementation.

    Scalability Concerns: With anticipated growth, the team highlighted the importance of implementing a more scalable architecture. We'll be exploring options like containerization with Docker and potentially moving towards a microservices approach for certain functionalities.

    Data Management: The team will focus on optimizing our database schema to handle increased product variations and customer data more efficiently. This includes implementing proper indexing and considering NoSQL solutions for certain data types.

    Security Enhancements: A security audit revealed the need for improved authentication mechanisms. We'll be implementing JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for more secure user sessions.

    Performance Monitoring: The team will set up comprehensive logging and monitoring using tools like Prometheus and Grafana to track system performance and identify bottlenecks.

    Bug Fixes: Several bugs were raised, including:
        Intermittent 500 errors during checkout process
        Inconsistent inventory updates after failed transactions
        Slow response times for product recommendation API

    Third-party Integrations: We'll be working on integrating with a shipping API to provide real-time shipping cost estimates to customers.

The team emphasized the need for thorough testing of these new implementations, particularly around the payment and inventory management systems. We've allocated additional time for unit and integration testing to ensure stability as we enhance our backend infrastructure.
