    "### What You'll Build\n",
    "In this hands-on lab, you'll create a sophisticated **Multi-Agent Portfolio Orchestrator** that demonstrates advanced AI coordination patterns using the Strands framework. This system combines multiple specialized AI agents to analyze market data, create investment strategies, and enable human oversight.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Understand multi-agent coordination using Strands \"agents as tools\" pattern  \n",
    "- Implement human-in-the-loop decision making\n",

    "This system demonstrates a **Multi-Agent Portfolio Orchestrator** that:\n",
    "1. **Analyzes** historical market data to create portfolio strategies\n",
    "2. **Recommends** optimal portfolios using AI analysis  \n",
    "3. **Enables** human decision-making with natural language overrides\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Architecture\n",
    "The system consists of:\n",
    "- **Portfolio Orchestrator**: Coordinates all specialist agents\n",
    "- **6 Specialist Agents**: Each with focused responsibilities\n",
    "    - **Stock Data Agent** - Fetches and caches market data with dual CSV storage\n",
    "    - **Growth Strategy Agent** - Creates high-return, growth-focused portfolios  \n",
    "    - **Diversified Strategy Agent** - Builds balanced, risk-managed portfolios\n",
    "    - **Performance Calculator Agent** - Converts abstract returns into concrete $1000 projections\n",
    "    - **Visualization Agent** - Creates professional charts and comparisons\n",
    "    - **Validation Agent** - Tests strategies against actual market performance\n",
    "- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Allow for human intervention, return of control to the human and compare with choices made by the agent.\n",
